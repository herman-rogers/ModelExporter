# ModelExporter
Export .OBJ Models from SpeedTree to normal .obj meshes to prep for mesh combining.

Basically import the prefab/texture file from your target project, add the prefab to the scene, select it, click on File > Export > Wavefront OBJ.
This will create a .obj file that you can now import back into your project.
